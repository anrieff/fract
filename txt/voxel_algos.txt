1. Rasterizing Techniques:

	1.1.	Simple bruteforce ( O(N^2) triangles )
	1.2.	LOD scheme (depends on terrain, tunable)
	1.3.	The hybrid algo
	
2. Raytracing Methods (for tracing one ray to the heightfield):

	2.1.	Simple bruteforce (advance max 1 dist at XZ plane and see when
		the ray intersects the heightfield)
	2.2.	"Fast Grid traversal"
	2.3.	Even faster grid traversal with two level hierarchy
	2.4.	Full hierarchy scheme, with mipmap level for each power of 2
	2.5.	Steepest descent (ascent)
	2.6.	Localized steepest descent (the steepest descent value is not
		constant throughout the scene, but depends on your current 
		position).
