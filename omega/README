0. Overview
-----------

This is the Omega project, an experiment dedicated to exploring some usual and
unusual fractals. It features SDL graphic interface, multithreaded computations
and plugin-based architecture, which allows new fractal formulas to be
implemented in a very easy manner.

1. Build prerequisites
----------------------

You will need
	- GNU Make (gmake)
	- Some compiler (gcc, msvc...)
	- SDL (www.libsdl.org)
	- cxxptl (svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fract/cxxptl)


If you have a GNU compatible build environment (e.g. Linux, or MinGW under Win32),
building is as easy as running `make'. No configuration is needed.

2. Writing a plugin
-------------------

Refer to pluginmanager.h for information how to create new plugins, which
could represent some fractal (for rendering the Julia set, for example)
