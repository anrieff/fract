	[***] multithreaded antibuffer init
	[***] Change the sphere-holding thingy in oldbench.fsv
	[***] Vectorize shaders
	[***] Include an installation ID in the result fmt (maybe time_t?)
	[   ] Readd SSE2 and SSE3 implementations of vector3
	[***] Try compile with VC 8.0
	[***] Output to temp.txt (FPS & CPU MHz atleast)
	[***] Compile a realistic changelog
	[***] Fix the loop options
	[***] Don't output result file if ESC is pressed

wxfractgui:
	[   ] Browse the last result

NICE_TO_HAVE:
fract:
	[   ] "Toto" scene
