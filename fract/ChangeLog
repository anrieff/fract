Differences from 1.06a to 1.07a
--------------------------------

   *    New GUI, which features result browser, result compare and direct
        result upload to the server

   *    Loop options were broken in 1.06a, fixed;

   *    Added adaptive antialiasing, with several FSAA patterns defined;

   *    Added parallel view mode;

   *    Added realistic soft shadows;

   *    Shadows are now cast on spheres, too. Meshes also cast shadows 
        (currently only convex meshes are supported);

   *    Better multithreading, shadow rendering is multithreaded, shaders
        are multithreaded and speeded up;

Differences from 1.05b to 1.06a
--------------------------------

   *    Advanced prefiller sphere mapping resulting in better smoothing of
        sphere edges.

   *    Added triangle rendering support. Currently the following features are
        implemented:
                - Phong Shading
                - Stochastic (perlin noise) intensity offset mapping
                - Reflections (optimized)
                - Texture mapping
                - Normal mapping

   *    Floor texture should now be smoother

   *    Added proper mipmap selection for sphere and triangle reflections

   *    Autodetecting number of CPUs

   *    Added "Object Glow" effect

   *    Fixed a string of minor bugs
